# Farsight

## Introduction

## 1. Step:

* Make it work with simple numbers.
  * How to go about checking neighoring numbers?
* How far can you see?
  * Where are points that you can't see above?
  * Make sure you can't see around corners.
* Distance between single points of height.
  * How does sight change with shorter/longer distance between points?

## 2. Step:

Make it realistic. The earth isn't flat. When does it begin to curve?

## 3. Step:

Make it work on a map.
